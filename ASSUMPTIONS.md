Assumptions
___________________________________________________________

1) It was assumed that the public IP Address is always available - and that the APIs always return a positive response.

2) It was assumed that authentication was not required and that only the username needed to be stored in redux in order for it to be displayed. The email and password are unnecessary in this case

3) It was assumed that there is only one type of login - a user - and so, no functionality as an admin (such as editing games, adding games) were added onto the interface.

4) It was assumed that Games that did not contain a description still needed to have the same functionality in case these were added eventually.
